# hackoverflow_veltech_decoders
The project FARMER'S ELF is created by the team VEL TECH DECODERS. The members are Saurav Kr Gupta, Rohit Kumar, Mayurakshya Paul and Shourjya Hazra. The project has been created for HACKOVERFLOW 2.0 organized by RAJALAKSHMI ENGINEERING COLLEGE on 1st and 2nd April, 2022.
The project is a multi-lingual and user friendly website created for the farming community of the country which cannot afford heavy robotics and technology. The project is built on PYTHON language, contains various modules namely Disease prediction module, crop recommendation module, fertilizer prediction module and future price prediction module. These modules are integrated and presented in the form of a website using HTML and CSS language.
